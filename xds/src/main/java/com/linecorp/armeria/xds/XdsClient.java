 * updates using this class. The appropriate resources are found from a {@link Bootstrap}
 * that can be provided like the following:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Bootstrap bootstrap = ...;
 * XdsClient xdsClient = XdsClient.of(bootstrap);
 * xdsClient.startWatch(type, resourceName);
 * xdsClient.addEndpointWatcher(type, resourceName, watcher).

 * via {@link #startWatch(String, String)}.
 * Note that it is important to close the {@link XdsClient} after usage to avoid leaking resources.
